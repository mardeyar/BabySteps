* Edit profile: spelled baby's name wrong? Want to change their profile picture? You can make those edits!

## Development Setup

Any IDE should work, platform dependent. Recommended to use either [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for developing native Android code or [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for developing native code on iOS. If you're not developing any native code you can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Before getting started you will need to ensure all dependencies are installed. Do so by running the following:

```git clone https://github.com/mardeyar/BabySteps.git```

```cd Project/Directory/location```

```npm install```

Replace "Project/Directory/location" with the actual root location of where you git cloned. Running **npm install** will install all needed dependencies for the project.
